  * command-line tool for generating random credentials.
  * s/policy/allow/
  * Cleaning up some imports.
  * Need to append port to host if it's non-standard.
  * New key-value store backend mostly cribbed from Six Apart's django-
    kvstore project (new BSD license included).
  * What if auditor is not None!?
  * HTTPException knows how to serialize itself into an HTTP response.
    Now handling exceptional conditions can be centralized.
  * Only set request content-type if it's in the environ.
  * Accept a list of tuples or a dictionary for headers.
  * Copy URL parameters when cloning a URL.
  * Simplify HTTP response.
  * starting in on some documentation.
  * What's this thing for, anyways?
  * Use kvstore for TimeLocks.
  * HTTP tests, auth tests, and a couple high level tests.
  * Dependency inject teh policies.
  * fix response encoding test.
  * Tests for KVStore storage backends.
  * testing turned up some bugs in kvstore. big surprise.

  [ Paul Lathrop ]
  * add init script and default file
  * add dirs file so log dir is created properly
  * add /etc/goldengate
  * use correct name for init script
  * fix build dependency
  * update init dependencies
  * fix mistake in init script
  * add depedency
  * fix package names
  * run as nobody user

  [ mmalone ]
  * Try using pylibmc first for memcache kvstore backend.
  * Test memcached kvstore backend.
  * readme dependencies.
  * relative imports are better here.
  * Tests for AWS Request.
  * Make sure GoldenGate raises exception for unauthorized /
    unauthenticated requests.
  * Factor out AWS stuff from auth core.
  * Make sure request headers is a list.
  * headers are lists of tuples now.
  * documentating credential store and whatnot.
  * pass entity through to matcher and implement entity matcher and
    other boolean matcher combinations.
  * Added timestamp to audit trail logging.
  * Documented broken-ness.
  * refactorizing to use updated abstractions.
  * Several new tests.
  * Cleaned up the settings situation. Now you can specify a settings
    file via the environment variable GOLDENGATE_PATH.
  * Pass notification recipients into TimeLockPolicy.
  * Todo list.

  [ Ian Eure ]
  * Ignore virtualenv trash & .pyc files.
  * Fix dependencies.
  * Raise exception instances instead of classes.
  * Clean whitespace.
  * Don’t return in __init__.
  * Fix references to simplejson.
  * Make configs printable.
  * Fix storage_backend setting, which was broken.
  * Return early.
  * Fix included packages, submodules weren't being installed.
  * Don’t import `goldengate.application' in `goldengate.__init__', it
    makes the import path insane. Tell gunicorn to use
    `goldengate.goldengate.application' instead.
  * Fix the init script:  - Give gunicorn a second to start up.  - Don’t
    set $DAEMONUSER, we’re telling gunicorn to drop privs instead.  -
    Fix the `running_pid' call, which expected the commandline to be the
    full path to the daemon rather than the basename.
  * Add versioning stuff as with SG.
  * Use nose instead of unittest2 (which isn’t packaged). Run tests &
    record coverage in package build.
  * Ignore more build artifacts.
  * Rename config environment variable.
